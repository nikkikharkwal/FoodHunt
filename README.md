# FoodHunt

A web project built using Web Technologies such as Html, Css, Javascript and PHP. This project aims to simplify the food ordering and payment process by removing the overheads such as long queues of people waiting for their turn to order food and make payment.

## Brief overview of the technology:


**Front end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML: HTML is used to create and save web document. E.g. Notepad/Notepad++

CSS : (Cascading Style Sheets) Create attractive Layout

Bootstrap : responsive design mobile freindly site

JavaScript: it is a programming language, commonly use with web browsers.


**Back end**: PHP, MySQL

PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a technology that allows software developers to create dynamically generated web pages, in HTML, XML, or other document types, as per client request. PHP is open source software.

MySQL: MySql is a database, widely used for accessing querying, updating, and managing data in databases.

**What's lacking?** Dynamic payment(real payment system) and error reporting lacks in this project. And also one might wish for showing corresponding food item's photo and all that stuff.
